This code (written completely by me* - switch486) is a 'hobby task'.

The aim of this application is to run some static code analysis tools (checkstyle, findbugs) on each newest svn revisions and send email notifications if there are some potentialy dangerous code parts or style is misused...

Hope it improves the quality of Your code
